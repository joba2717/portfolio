                <h4>Alumni Network</h4>
                <p>
                    Umeå University's alumni section asked for inspiration to kickstart their work on their new Alumni Network.
                    We worked in a team of four and through polls, testing and interviews we made a design mock-up of the new Alumni Network page.

                <h4>Super Quiz</h4>
                <p>
                    A project in a course about Database Technology gave us free reins to come up with a web based application utilizing a SQL database.
                    The finished application was a fun trivia based quiz site with quizzes in a bunch of different categories.

                <h4>This Portfolio</h4>
                <p>
                    This portfolio is a project in itself. This entire webpage was made using html, CSS and JavaScript. While learning about
                    web development I saw a perfect opportunity to update my portfolio and make it completely my own.

            <h2>Alumni Network</h2>
            <p>
                The old alumni network at Umeå University were really getting out dated and we got the chance to inspire and come up with
                ideas of how the alumni section at Umeå University could evolve into something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                We worked in a group of four and we started to gather data through interviews, polls och testing.
                The data was later used in brainstorming sessions as cornerstones to develop a new alumni network.
                The mock-up was created using Adobe Illustrator and  a few screenshots of the result can be shown below.
            </p>
            <p>
                When working on similar projects on my own before, I had a bad habit to get stuck on different ideas.
                Working creatively in a team has really helped me to be more open minded. Sometimes the best idea isn't
                the one in your own head but in the silent guy's next to you.

            <h2>SuperQuiz</h2>
            <p>
                Some projects basically had no instructions other than "create something". The final project in a course about 
                database technology was just like that. I was set to create a web application utilizing a SQL database but other than that, 
                NO INSTRUCTIONS. So, me and my partner came up with Super Quiz, a fun trivia site where users can test their trivia skills in a variety 
                of categories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing Super Quiz was a lot of fun. The quiz site is simple, easy to use and kind of addicting if you like trivia knowledge. 
                For the questions we used an open trivia database with over 3700 questions. 
                We integrated the trivia database to our system using the API connected to the trivia database. 
                We wrote the application in Visual Studio using .NET Core MVC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating a working web application with an integrated SQL database helped me learn a lot about the basics of 
                web development as well as SQL in general.
